# Bachelor thesis: exploring algorithmic detection of fake news
From [this](https://www.kaggle.com/fivethirtyeight/russian-troll-tweets/home), I'm going to construct a couple of classifiers.

## Step 1: literature
Understanding what makes fake news fake news. 
Goals:
* Find a definition of fake news
* Find related research to algorithmic detection of 'falseness'
* Find common methods of NLP to use
* Find common ways of handling Twitter data

## Step 2: preprocessing
Prepping the data before constructing classifiers.
Goals:
* Clean up the main data
* Find related datasets with tweets to be labeled as 'real news', as a result from the definition from literature research
* Clean and combine the additional datasets

## Step 3: classification
Defining and testing out classifiers
Goals:
* Define which classifiers can be used and make sense
* Find good evaluation methods
* Compare classifiers
