\subsection{Acknowledgements}
First of all, I would like to thank my supervisor, dr. Maarten Marx, for his guidance and advice in the past couple of weeks. 
I also want to thank Wesley Teunissen for helping me gathering the results, and Agnita Tesselaar for bringing me all the cups of tea in the past three years.

This thesis is dedicated to my grandfather, Theodorus Tesselaar.
Although he is not with us anymore, my Mom said he would have been proud of me.
