\subsection{RQ1}
Fake news as a term only caught public attention starting from the end of 2016, during the Presidential Elections of the United States \cite{googletrends2019}.   

\subsection{RQ2}
In the last couple of years, using transfer learning for natural language processing has given promisable results. The following sentence embeddings will be used to detect fake news:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Bag of Words as a baseline for performance of non-pretrained embeddings;
    \item Facebook's InferSent \cite{conneau2017};
    \item ELMo from the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence \cite{peters2018};
    \item OpenAI's GPT-2 \cite{radford2019};
    \item Transformer-XL \cite{dai2019};
    \item Microsoft's MT-DNN  \cite{liu2019};
    \item and Google's BERT \cite{devlin2018}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{RQ3}
Aligned with the original research on this dataset by Wang \cite{wang2018}, the following machine learning algorithms will be used to test the applicability of the abovementioned embedding techniques: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item SVMs;
    \item Logistic regression;
    \item Bi-LSTMs;
    \item CNNs.
\end{itemize}
